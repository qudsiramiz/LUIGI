# LUIGI
Lexi User Interface for Graphical Interaction

## How to run the programme

1. Download the code to a folder
2. Open a terminal in the folder and type `$./lxi_gui.sh`. If for some reason this doesn't work, check if the file `lxi_gui.sh` is an executable file or not (if it is not, then run the command `$chmod a+x lxi_gui.sh` to make it executable).

3. If you are not using terminal, then use any python (version 3.6 or above, which has pandas and seaborn packages installed) to run the file `lxi_gui.py` and the GUI will pop-up.

4. The plan is to eventually make the code windows executable.

Please let me know if you have any trouble.
