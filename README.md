## How to run the programme/use the code

### For Windows:
1. If you are on Windows, you can download the executable file for LUIGI by clicking on this link: [LUIGI Windows](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LIOiDWf1iVsBD70_NCvknc1s4m35v0A-?usp=sharing)

### For Windows/Unix/Mac Os Systems:
1. Download the code.
2. Open a terminal in the folder and type `$./lxi_gui.sh`. If for some reason this doesn't work, check if the file `lxi_gui.sh` is an executable file or not.
    * if it is not, then run the command`$chmod a+x lxi_gui.sh` to make it executable    
4. If you are not using terminal, then use any python (version 3.6 or above, which has pandas and seaborn packages installed) to run the file `lxi_gui.py` and the GUI will pop-up.

Please let me know if you have any trouble in using the program.
